# Snake Game (coded in python🐍)

Hi! In this repository you will gonna find a implementation of SnakeGame coded in python. It is not completed yet. 

Inspired by: [my and a friend´s final project of "Programming Language I", discipline of IT university classes](https://github.com/JulioMelo-Classes/LP1-2022.1-Snaze) -> This link it´s just for _default_ sources

These are the implemented classes:
- SnakeGame
- Player
- Snake
- Level


<div align='center'>
<img src='images/menu.png' height=50 width=300>
<br><br>

> When it´s running, what you will see: <br>

<img src="images/snakegame.png" height=150 width=250> </img>
</div>

For now, the maze has no walls, just free spaces for snake to 'run'
