In this repository, I'm keeping part of my python study journey. Here you can find notebooks and python codes to basic concepts and algorithms that can help a lot during development. I hope you find it useful.

PS. A lot of examples were extracted from 'Fluent Python' book.

PS 2. There are lots of classes related to Python language from BackEnd Python Bootcamp of @WoMakersCode @2024 | Janeiro
